## Stegos Blockchain
Stegos is a completely private, confidential, and scalable cryptocurrency thatâ€™s friendly to the environment. Stegos builds and improves upon other privacy coins and can be used to send payments and data with complete confidentiality.

Stegos uses the UTXO (coin) model and PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus.

Transactions in Stegos are unlinkable, untraceable, and completely confidential. Stegos makes it impossible to identify recipients of a transaction because transactions are directed to new and unique addresses.

Stegos makes it impossible to trace history of transactions since many individual transactions are joined together to form a super-transaction. This is done in a secure and privacy-preserving way, before submitting the transaction to blockchain validators. Stegos coins are fully fungible!

All amounts in Stegos are hidden using cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proofs. Validator stakes and transaction fees are the only exception since these must be visible for blockchain validation.
